				<p class="subheader">Problem</p>
				<p class="subheader-desc">How do you present a lot of information for a user’s profile in a limited amount of space?</p>
				<p class="subheader">Features</p>
				<p class="subheader-desc">After discussion with the product manager and founder, these are the list of features that they wanted me to bring together:</p>
				<ul class="subheader-desc">
					<li>Basic information about the pet and owner</li>
					<li>A detailed “About” page to display the story of the pet and owner</li>
					<li>Action items associated with the profile such as messaging, following, seeing the badges that the pet has earned</li>
					<li>Photo, trails, services, and product filter categories for profile posts</li>
					<li>A way to add new content</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="subheader">Research</p>
				<p class="subheader-desc">Since I was starting from scratch, I had no idea where to start. I researched how other designers have solved similar problems in the past by browsing Pinterest, Creative Bloq, and the apps that I often use in my phone.</p>
				<p class="subheader">Design Concept</p>
				<p class="subheader-desc">I fleshed out my ideas by heavily drawing inspiration from the layout of Facebook’s profile UI and Instagram’s double navigation UI. I had to go through a couple of iterations to figure out the best way to display the profile information.</p>
				<p class="subheader">Iteration 1</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-4">
						<img class="full-width shadow" src="images/spetcial/petpal_ios_v3-1.png">
					</div>
					<div class="col-8">
						<ul class="subheader-desc">
							<li>I decided to include the owner’s profile picture next to the main pet profile picture mainly to help personalize the pet profile more. Also, an owner profile picture is necessary for a future feature where owners will be matched to other owners for pet hangouts.</li>
							<li>Since I was only allowed to use half of the screen for profile information, I needed to cram everything to the right of the profile picture. I designed icons for each item to decrease the amount of text as much as possible.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="subheader">Iteration 2</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-4">
						<img class="full-width shadow" src="images/spetcial/petpal_ios_v3-2.png">
					</div>
					<div class="col-8">
						<ul class="subheader-desc">
							<li>While adding a new feature to allow for direct messaging of a user from the profile, I realized that grouping the action items (about, message, follow) together would help users find them more intuitively.</li>
							<li>After discussing with the PM the need for gamification, we decided on badges. I added a display of the highest badge a user has earned next to the profile picture so that the badge would visually be associated with the pet.</li>
							<li>When I asked my friends for feedback on the profile UI that I mocked up on Illustrator, they found it to be confusing and too overwhelming.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="subheader">Iteration 3</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-4">
						<img class="full-width shadow" src="images/spetcial/petpal_ios_v3-4.png">
					</div>
					<div class="col-8">
						<ul class="subheader-desc">
							<li>I decided to do a complete UI redesign because the layout was too cluttered. To avoid having layers of buttons one after the other, I placed the profile picture in the middle of the profile and message buttons. I decreased the space that the extra details was taking up by putting them in a paragraph format.</li>
							<li>To make it more obvious that the follower information, treats, and badge level are clickable buttons, I placed them in squares with plenty of padding to decrease the cluttered look.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="subheader">Iteration 4</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-4">
						<img class="full-width shadow" src="images/spetcial/petpal_ios_v3-5.png">
					</div>
					<div class="col-8">
						<ul class="subheader-desc">
							<li>After surveying target users, we found that they were not as interested in how many treats (“likes”) a pet has received, so I removed it to further decrease the clutter.</li>
							<li>I added labels to the action item buttons to be clarify what they are, but put the text and circle outline in gray to add the illusion of more space.</li>
							<li>To allow users to personalize their profile more, I included an option to add a cover photo background.</li>

				<p class="subheader-desc">How do you define the first time user experience to encourage users to keep coming back?</p>
				<p class="subheader">Hypothesis</p>
				<ul class="subheader-desc">
					<li>Signing up should be hassle-free and take less than 5 minutes so that the users can experience the product first before committing a lot of time for set up.</li>
					<li>Users should be able to discover new content that is relevant to them each time they visit the website.</li>
					<li>Adding awards can further incentivize users to take certain actions.</li>
				</ul>
				<img class="full-width" src="images/spetcial/spetcial_homepage_sketch.jpg">
				<p class="subheader">Features</p>
				<ul class="subheader-desc">
					<li>Social media sign up options to fill in basic information fast</li>
					<li>Allow profiles to have incomplete information</li>
					<li>Introduce gamification with a badging system</li>
					<li>Home page has new discoverable content that is relevant to the user</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="subheader">Prototyping</p>
				<p class="subheader-desc">I sketched quick wireframes to help envision what sequence of events would happen when a user first signs up on the website.</p>
				<ul class="subheader-desc">
					<li>When the user is not signed into the website, I envisioned the homepage to look something like Yelp since the product is aiming to become the database for everything pet-related. New content can be discovered with site wide trending items and featured items near a location.</li>
					<li>Only the most basic information is required to sign up, so the profile will display a message that the profile is incomplete and that a badge will be rewarded for filling in information.</li>
					<li>Once the user clicks into the message or visits his/her profile, there will be a highlighted message box at the top that can be dismissed that will encourage the user to fill in certain profile information. Filling out the profile is broken into parts by awarding different levels of a badge so that the user is not overwhelmed with filling out everything at once.</li>
					<li>To make filling out information very easy, the items can be edited in line like LinkedIn.</li>

				<p class="subheader">Iteration 2</p>
				<p class="subheader-desc">Realizing that I was thinking too far ahead into the future, I took a couple steps back and made mockups for how the sign up process should look like for a very easy to implement FTUE.</p>
				<ul class="subheader-desc">
					<li>By requiring only the most basic information and letting the rest of the fields be optional, I tried to make the sign up process as low commitment as possible.</li>

				<p class="subheader">Variations</p>
				<ul class="subheader-desc">
					<li>First, I came up with a couple variations using different colors. I tried to be more inclusive of both cat and dog owners by creating a version with pointy ears that could either be a dog or a cat.</li>
					<li>By showing only half of the dog’s face, I tried to make the logo more abstract and simple. Also, I worked towards adding more professionalism by paying special attention to symmetry and regularity.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="subheader">Final Logo</p>
				<ul class="subheader-desc">
					<li>After surveying 100 target users, we found that the mouthless dog with the blue color was the most well-liked. </li>
					<li>It was then a challenge to make the finalized logo versatile to different colored backgrounds. Converting all the colored parts to white was not an option because the dog would take on the color of the colored background and change the entire feel of the logo. In the end, I made the background circle a lighter opacity and filled the dog with a white color.</li>
