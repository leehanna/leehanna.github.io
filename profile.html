			<h4 class="section-header header-fontstyle">Summary</h4>
			<p class="desc-fontstyle">I am a full-stack designer and developer with previous experience in designing and building web/mobile interfaces for a social enterprise in Cambodia, a Bay Area startup for pet owners, and California’s redistricting database. I have also interned as a software engineer at Salesforce and received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at UC Berkeley.</p>

			<h4 class="section-header header-fontstyle">How I got into design</h4>
			<p class="desc-fontstyle">When I was in high school in 2011, I interned as a layout designer at a publishing company, which started my design career. I was amazed at how much thought went behind every single element on a page, and how these elements can subconsciously influence the viewer. For a brief time, I wanted to go into business since I loved using design thinking to come up with marketing strategies.</p>
			<p class="desc-fontstyle">In the end, computer science won me over when I first tasted that magical feeling from solving what seems like a puzzle to build something you can <i>interact with</i>. Even while studying computer science in college, I was never far from design or marketing strategy since I somehow ended up designing publicity materials for all six of the clubs I was involved in.</p>
			<p class="desc-fontstyle">Now, I am aspiring to become a product designer since it luckily combines all of the fields I was ever intrigued by into one: psychology, business, tech, and design.</p>
