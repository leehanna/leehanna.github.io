<div class="work-section grid-12">
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Previous Advertisement</h4>
	<p>From the previous advertisement, the main change they wanted to make was to have more succinct descriptions of each restaurant and  introduce a new direction for the subsequent year's design.</p>
	<div class="img-container">

<div class="work-section grid-12">
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Proposed Versions</h4>
	<p>To start off, I created a similar version to the original that used pictures from each restaurant. We chose pictures of people to convey that these restaurants are not only about food; they are about helping marginalized youths.</p>
	<div class="img-container">
		<img src={{ imagefolderurl | append: "TREE_NyoNyum_conservative.jpg" }} class="img-3quarters-width">
		<p class="img-caption">A fallback conservative version</p>
	</div>
	<p>When I was analyzing the other competing advertisements in the magazine, the ones that stood out to me the most were those that had a clear focus visually. So for the subsequent versions, I utilized only one picture that has a main visual focus on food, but still had the vocational training students and teachers in the background.</p>
	<div class="img-container">
		<img src={{ imagefolderurl | append: "TREE_NyoNyum_amok.jpg" }} class="img-3quarters-width">
		<p class="img-caption">Version emphasizing a traditional Cambodian dish (fish amok) with workers in the back</p>
	</div>
	<div class="img-container">
		<img src={{ imagefolderurl | append: "TREE_NyoNyum_Hanna_2017_studentteacher.jpg" }} class="img-3quarters-width">
		<p class="img-caption">Version showing student and teacher interaction to highlight the vocational training aspect of the restaurant</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="work-section grid-12">
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Final Version</h4>
	<p>The final version that was chosen for the magazine was one where the teachers were facing directly at the camera and offering the food. Advertisements that make eye contact with the viewer increases engagement, and was thus more effective in conveying the vocational training aspect of the TREE restaurants.</p>
