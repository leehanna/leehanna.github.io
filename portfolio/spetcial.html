<div class="work-section grid-12">
	<h2 class="header-fontstyle">1. Establishing a brand identity</h2>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Target User Profile</h4>
	<p>After approaching some pet owners in the San Francisco Bay Area, the team gathered some statistics that the target user group roughly consists of 70% women and 30% men in their 20s to 40s, and they are economically well off to support their pets. </p>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Competitive Analysis</h4>
	<p>During my research of major pet store brands and apps, I found that the feel of the logo is similar to baby brands — rounded, friendly, and bright.</p>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Initial Variations</h4>
	<p>I mocked up some different ideas with different combinations of colors, fonts, brand names, and animals. My approach to the balance between professionalism and friendliness was by keeping a minimalistic feel.</p>

		<img src={{ imagefolderurl | append: "petpal_logo_initial_variations.png" }} class="img-3quarters-width">
	</div>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Final Logo</h4>
	<p>After surveying 100 target users of different logo variations and numerous discussions, this is the logo that we decided to go for:</p>

	<h2 class="header-fontstyle">2. Setting the Foundations for the Mobile UI</h2>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Usability Analysis</h4>
	<p>Given a long list of items that the team wanted to see in the user profile page, I closely analyzed how the most successful social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram managed to cram so much information without overwhelming the user. </p>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Mobile Profile UI Design Development</h4>
	<p>I went through several versions of the profile UI: to improve upon each version, I continually researched existing UI trends and asked users if the organization of the page made sense to them and see if they had trouble locating specific information.</p>
	<div class="grid-4 s-grid-12 pad-2 s-pad-0">
		<div class="img-container bordered">
			<img src={{ imagefolderurl | append: "petpal_ios_v3-1.png" }}>
		</div>
		<p>I first was able to work with only half the screen space for the profile information, but users were overwhelmed with how crammed everything was. The icons also made no sense because they are not established icons like Instagram’s.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="grid-4 s-grid-12 pad-2 s-pad-0">
		<div class="img-container bordered">
			<img src={{ imagefolderurl | append: "petpal_ios_v3-2.png" }}>
		</div>
		<p>I switched out the icons to emphasize the numbers instead, and grouped the new action items together. Testing revealed that people could not read the letters at all and while they noted that the  grouping of the action items made sense, they said that the profile was too cluttered.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="grid-4 s-grid-12 pad-2 s-pad-0">
		<div class="img-container bordered">
			<img src={{ imagefolderurl | append: "petpal_ios_v3-4.png" }}>
		</div>
		<p>After much discussion, I showed the need for more screen space for profile information. In this version, I visually differentiated basic profile description, action items, and information that can be pressed for more information. Users were confused by the icons of the action items and their location.</p>
	</div>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle extra-top-space">Mobile Profile UI Final Design</h4>
	<p>After adding labels, shifting around the action items, omitting the option to view the number of treats, and adding a cover photo background for additional personalization, this was the final version of the mobile profile UX.</p>
	<div class="img-container">
		<img class="img-mobile-screen" src={{ imagefolderurl | append: "petpal_iphone_final_profile.png" }}>
	</div>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">UI/UX Mockups</h4>
	<p>Concurrently, I was quickly designing the UI/UX of other screens so that the growing team of developers could have a basic vision of what the different parts of the app should look like. I based the mockups on my research and analysis of the usability of other social media applications.</p>

	<h2 class="header-fontstyle">3. First time user experience strategy for web</h2>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Brainstorming</h4>
	<p>To think about a complicated problem, I start off with pen and paper to brainstorm ideas.</p>
	<div class="img-container">
		<img class="img-3quarters-width" src={{ imagefolderurl | append: "spetcial_homepage_sketch.jpg" }}>
	</div>
	<p>My key takeaways were:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Signing up should be hassle-free and take less than 5 minutes so that the users can experience the product first before committing a lot of time for set up.</li>
		<li>Users should be able to discover new content that is relevant to them each time they visit the website.</li>
		<li>Adding awards incentivizes users to take certain actions.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Wireframe Sketches</h4>
	<p>Next, I sketched out some wireframes on a tablet to map out basic interactions.</p>

	</div>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">UI Design of Homepage</h4>
	<p>Based on web design guidelines, I fleshed out the homepage on Illustrator to prepare for testing.</p>
	<div class="grid-12">
		<div class="grid-6 s-grid-12 pad-2 s-pad-1">

<div class="work-section">
	<h4 class="header-fontstyle">Reflections</h4>
	<p>Through this project, I  realized that my background in computer science really helps me to bridge the gap between the engineering team and the design team. Additionally, instead of telling the engineers to fix CSS, I could make edits myself, thereby saving a lot of time.<br/>
	Most of the mockups had to be made really quickly during the time I worked in this startup; it was difficult to prioritize which screens should be rolled out first and what other screens I can take more time to conduct user tests. Next time I work on a similar project, I will work on some simpler UIs that developers can reference to build up to the final vision.</p>
