<div class="work-section grid-12">
  <h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Design Reasoning</h4>
  <p>Adeste Fideles means “O come, all ye faithful,” which I represented with a dove that symbolizes the Holy Spirit.  The target of this design was 60% male and 40% female with an age range from 20 all the way to 35, so I chose a script font that is more appealing to this group.<br/>
  Since the purpose of this shirt was recruitment, I made a design for the back of the shirt that prominently describes what the organization is. When members wear this shirt at church, it can help arouse the curiosity of parents and potential new members.</p>
