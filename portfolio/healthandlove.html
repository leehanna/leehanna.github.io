	<h2 class="header-fontstyle">1. Experience Strategy</h2>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Original Branding and Website Structure</h4>
	<p>Health &amp; Love is a project that had been largely untouched for the past few years, so everything about it was very outdated. Besides the main logo, Health &amp; Love has a character called Dr. Love that users can anonymously ask questions about sexual health or get relationship advice.<br/>
	The website’s two main functions is to provide articles on varying sexual health topics and to provide a place where people can ask additional unanswered questions to Dr. Love.</p>

	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Competitive Analysis</h4>
	<p>Currently, finding information about sexual health is difficult in Cambodia because of the lack of websites that offer it and the culture that discourages talking about sexual topics in the open. The few websites that did offer it were news sites that have a section on “Love / Relationships” or sites run by NGOs that had a very western look. To see how sexual health information was conveyed effectively to teens, I referenced some western and Korean websites.</p>
	<div class="links">
		<a href={{ imagefolderurl | append: "Health and Love Competitive Analysis.pdf" }} class="link-fontstyle">Full Competitive Analysis</a>
	</div>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Structuring the Website</h4>
	<p>Next, to gain effective insight on how to effectively structure the information on the website, I requested analytics of the current website to see which pages were most frequently accessed. The most popular pages were Contraception and Asking Dr. Love.</p>
	<div class="links">
		<ul>
			<li><a class="link-fontstyle" href={{ imagefolderurl | append: "webpage_statistics.docx" }}>Website Statistics</a></li>
			<li><a class="link-fontstyle" href={{ imagefolderurl | append: "healthandlove_overview.pdf" }}>Website Structure Proposed Changes</a></li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Wireframes</h4>
	<p>Based on my research, I created wireframes for both desktop and mobile. More Cambodians have smartphones than laptops, so having a responsive website was even more essential.</p>

	<h2 class="header-fontstyle">2. User research for Branding</h2>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Cultural Research</h4>
	<p>My original intention was to go straight to web design, but the logo is the main face of the website and the brand, and it was simply too outdated for further use. My first step was to get to know cultural trends of younger Cambodians by going to markets, people watching in cafes, and speaking to some locals.<br/>
	My research revealed that Cambodian young adults were very much into Korean culture (K-pop, K-dramas), streetwear brands such as Supreme and Adidas, and the cutesy-ness often found in some Asian brands.</p>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Focus Group Research</h4>
	<p>After creating several versions of the logo and Dr. Love, I led two 1 hour long session focus groups with five Cambodian college students each to gain insight on design direction. I made some adjustments based on my findings from the first group before meeting with the second group.</p>
	<div class="links">
		<a href={{ imagefolderurl | append: "logo_research_findings.pdf"}} class="link-fontstyle">Focus Group Report</a>
	</div>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Final Logo and Dr. Love Character</h4>
	<p>The two focus groups gave me invaluable feedback and suggestions to better cater the final version of the logo and Dr. Love character to the target user group.</p>

<div class="work-section grid-12">
	<h2 class="header-fontstyle">3. Developing the Website</h2>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Website UI Design</h4>
	<p>The focus groups revealed that Cambodian young adults prefer a content-first, minimalistic website. I kept elements to a minimum, and emphasized the pictures. Since I already had mobile wireframes and was developing the website myself, I did not create mobile versions of the UI.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Developing the Website for Testing</h4>
	<p>The website is currently being developed using CraftCMS Pro on a <a href="http://beta.healthandlove.org/login" class="link-fontstyle">staging site</a> in preparation to be tested with users. Ideally, users would have been brought in to the office to test with wireframes, but my time in Cambodia only allowed enough time to organize two focus groups before development started. However, the team decided it would be best for me to develop the staging website remotely first so that staff members can pull up the website to test when visiting families during outreach.</p>

<div class="work-section grid-12">
	<h4 class="header-fontstyle">Reflections</h4>
	<p>I realized how important user research is during this project because it really helped shed light on how people of a completely different culture think. Since CraftCMS is very flexible and powerful with a great admin UI, I was able to focus on just getting the HTML/CSS together with Twig handling objects from the database.</p>
