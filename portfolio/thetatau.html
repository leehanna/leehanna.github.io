<div class="work-section grid-12">
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Brainstorming</h4>
	<p>For this flyer, I settled on a Lego theme because it is a part of most engineersâ€™ childhood and can thus establish an instant emotional connection. Establishing this emotional connection was my number one goal in order to increase the chances of a busy college student actually reading the flyer.</p>

<div class="work-section grid-12">
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Competitive Analysis</h4>
	<p>Going off of my idea of using Legos as the theme, I browsed the web to get some inspiration on engaging flyers and posters. I found that the bright colors of Legos were ideal for catching attention.</p>

	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Layout</h4>
	<p>I first designed the layout of the flyer to establish visual hierarchy using white space.</p>

	</div>

<div class="work-section grid-12">
	<h4 class="subheader-fontstyle">Visual Interest</h4>
	<p>Lastly, I added some bright colors and depth using shadows.</p>
